# Explain-100-Year-Weather-Events-with-Python

In recent years, I have been doing quite a few projects, where some extreme events were analyzed such as floods, river discharge flows,
wind storms, or significant wave heights, etc. Can you guess what the most interesting part is? It is neither data collecting and 
cleaning nor selecting the optimal extreme value distribution function or writing the technical memo. In fact, the most interesting 
part for me is to explain the final analysis results to the clients. I say this explanation is very interesting. On the one hand, 
it means that you have to explain the meaning of your analysis results to the customer. On the other hand, it sometimes means that 
you have to explain it to yourself first.

Let's take a 100-year flood as an example to have a look at some interesting questions our clients asked before. 
Some problems involve statistics, and are hard to describe in plain language. 
I will apply python to carry out some simple analysis.
